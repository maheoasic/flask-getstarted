- Any App consists of Code + Config, which runs on a VM or Node/
- VM with basic min oS services are available on Docker.
- On top of that you need to install some packages as per your App.
- Your App building consists of:

- Have some software like pyhon which runs your python code.
- You may have config files that, for example, exposes your Running Code or Service on a Port.

- Steps to run this Docker image on your linux host:

- $ cd flask-getstarted
- $ podman build .  # will build a local Docker image and print image name
- Example:
- --> d4cbc95e405
- d4cbc95e405967ca53e883d47274128fd907425a825033a94deb75a43d2689a1
- Run a Container from that Image: 1st few Char's of ImageID on STDOUT are enough
- $ podman run -p 8888:5000 --> d4cbc95e405
- Go to browser, type "<IP-of-fedoraVM>:8888" - you should see nice Cat GIF
- You may need to open port 8888 on your Fedora VirtualBox VM by:
- # firewall-cmd --add-port=8888/tcp
- # firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent  ## firewall rule persist REBOOTs
